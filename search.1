.TH search 1 "Dec 17, 1994"
.SH SEARCH
search \- search files (a'la grep) in a whole directory tree.
.SH SYNOPSIS
search [ grep-like and find-like options] [regex ....]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Search
is more or less a combo of 'find' and 'grep' (although the regular
expression flavor is that of the perl being used, which is closer to
egrep's than grep's).

.I Search
does generally the same kind of thing that
.nf
   find <blah blah> | xargs egrep <blah blah>
.fi
does, but is
.I much
more powerful and efficient (and intuitive, I think).

This manual describes
.I search
as of version "960325.7".
You can always find the latest version at
.nf
   http://www.wg.omron.co.jp/~jfriedl/perl/index.html
.fi

.SH "QUICK EXAMPLE"
Basic use is simple:
.nf
    % search jeff
.fi
will search files in the current directory, and all sub directories, for
files that have "jeff" in them. The lines will be listed with the
containing file's name prepended.
.PP
If you list more than one regex, such as with
.nf
    % search jeff Larry Randal+ 'Stoc?k' 'C.*son'
.fi
then a line containing any of the regexes will be listed.
This makes it effectively the same as
.nf
    % search 'jeff|Larry|Randal+|Stoc?k|C.*son'
.fi
However, listing them separately is much more efficient (and is easier
to type).
.PP
Note that in the case of these examples, the
.B \-w
(list whole-words only) option would be useful.
And if your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences, you can use
.B \-bold
to higlight the items found. Furthermore, if your display supports
color as well, you can use
.BR \-red ,
.BR \-green ,
.BR \-yellow ,
etc. instead to have the searched items marked with the given color.
.PP
Normally, various kinds of files are automatically removed from consideration.
If it has has a certain ending (such as ".tar", ".Z", ".o", .etc), or if
the beginning of the file looks like a binary, it'll be excluded.
You can control exactly how this works -- see below. One quick way to
override this is to use the
.B \-all
option, which means to consider all the files that would normally be
automatically excluded.
Or, if you're curious, you can use
.B \-why
to have notes about what files are skipped (and why) printed to stderr.

.SH "BASIC OVERVIEW"
Normally, the search starts in the current directory, considering files in
all subdirectories.

You can use the
.I ~/.search
file to control ways to automatically exclude files.
If you don't have this file, a default one will kick in, which automatically
add
.nf
    -skip .o .Z .gif
.fi
(among others) to exclude those kinds of files (which you probably want to
skip when searching for text, as is normal).
Files that look to be be binary will also be excluded.

Files ending with "#" and "~" will also be excluded unless the
.B -x~
option is given. 

You can use
.B -showrc
to show what kinds of files will normally be skipped.
See the section on the startup file
for more info.

You can use the
.B -all
option to indicate you want to consider all files that would otherwise be
skipped by the startup file.

Based upon various other flags (see "WHICH FILES TO CONSIDER" below),
more files might be removed from consideration. For example
.nf
    -mtime 3
.fi
will exclude files that aren't at least three days old (change the 3 to -3
to exclude files that are more than three days old), while
.nf
    -skip .*
.fi
would exclude any file beginning with a dot (of course, '.' and '..'  are
special and always excluded).

If you'd like to see what files are being excluded, and why, you can get the
list via the
.B \-why
option.

If a file makes it past all the checks, it is then "considered".
This usually means it is greped for the regular expressions you gave
on the command line.

If any of the regexes match a line, the line is printed.
However, if
.B -list
is given, just the filename is printed. Or, if
.B -nice
is given, a somewhat more (human-)readable output is generated.

If you're searching a huge tree and want to keep informed about how
the search is progressing,
.B -v
will print (to stderr) the current directory being searched.
Using
.B -vv
will also print the current file "every so often", which could be useful
if a directory is huge. Using
.B -vvv
will print the update with every file.

Below is the full listing of options.

.SH "OPTIONS TELLING *WHERE* TO SEARCH"
.TP
.BI -dir " DIR"
Start searching at the named directory instead of the current directory.
If multiple
.B -dir
arguments are given, multiple trees will be searched.
.TP
.BI -ddir " DIR"
Like
.B -dir
except it flushes any previous
.B -dir
directories (i.e. "-dir A -dir B -dir C" will search A, B, and C, while
"-dir A -ddir B -dir C" will search only B and C. This might be of use
in the startup file (see that section below).
.TP
.B -xdev
Stay on the same filesystem as the starting directory/directories.
.TP
.B -sort
Sort the items in a directory before processing them.
Normally they are processed in whatever order they happen to be read from
the directory.
.TP
.B -nolinks
Don't follow symbolic links. Normally they're followed.
.TP
.B -depth=0
Don't descend into subdirectories. Only a depth of 0 currently supported.
.SH "OPTIONS CONTROLLING WHICH FILES TO CONSIDER AND EXCLUDE"
.TP
.BI -mtime " NUM"
Only consider files that were last changed more than
.I NUM
days ago
(less than
.I NUM
days if
.I NUM
has '-' prepended, i.e. "-mtime -2.5" means to consider files that
have been changed in the last two and a half days).
.TP
.B -older FILE
Only consider files that have not changed since
.I FILE
was last changed.
If there is any upper case in the "-older", "or equal" is added to the sense
of the test.  Therefore, "search -older ./file regex" will never consider
"./file", while "search -Older ./file regex" will.

If a file is a symbolic link, the time used is that of the file and not the
link.
.TP
.BI -newer " FILE"
Opposite of
.BR -older .
.TP
.BI -name " GLOB"
Only consider files that match the shell filename pattern
.IR GLOB .
The check is only done on a file's name (use
.B -path
to check the whole path, and use
.B -dname
to check directory names).

Multiple specifications can be given by separating them with spaces, a'la
.nf
    -name '*.c *.h'
.fi
to consider C source and header files.
If
.I GLOB
doesn't contain any special pattern characters, a '*' is prepended.
This last example could have been given as
.nf
   -name '.c .h'
.fi
It could also be given as
.nf
    -name .c -name .h
.fi
or
.nf
    -name '*.c' -name '*.h'
.fi
or
.nf
    -name '*.[ch]'
.fi
(among others)
but in this last case, you have to be sure to supply the leading '*'.
.TP
.BI -path " GLOB"
Like
.B -name
except the entire path is checked against the pattern.
.TP
.B -regex " REGEX"
Considers files whose names (not paths) match the given perl regex
exactly.
.TP
.BI -iname " GLOB"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -name .
.TP
.BI -ipath " GLOB"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -path .
.TP
.BI -iregex " REGEX"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -regex .

.TP
.BI -dpath " GLOB"
Only search down directories whose path matches the given pattern (this
doesn't apply to the initial directory given by
.BI -dir ,
of course).
Something like
.nf
    -dir /usr/man -dpath /usr/man/man*
.fi
would completely skip
"/usr/man/cat1", "/usr/man/cat2", etc.
.TP
.BI -dskip " GLOB"
Skips directories whose name (not path) matches the given pattern.
Something like
.nf
    -dir /usr/man -dskip cat*
.fi
would completely skip any directory in the tree whose name begins with "cat"
(including "/usr/man/cat1", "/usr/man/cat2", etc.).
.TP
.BI -dregex " REGEX"
Like
.BI -dpath ,
but the pattern is a full perl regex. Note that this quite different
from
.B -regex
which considers only file names (not paths). This option considers
full directory paths (not just names). It's much more useful this way.
Sorry if it's confusing.
.TP
.BI -dpath " GLOB"
This option exists, but is probably not very useful. It probably wants to
be like the '-below' or something I mention in the "TODO" section.
.TP
.BI -idpath " GLOB"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -dpath .
.TP
.BI -idskip " GLOB"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -dskip .
.TP
.BI -idregex " REGEX"
Case-insensitive version of
.BR -dregex .
.TP
.B -all
Ignore any 'magic' or 'option' lines in the startup file.
The effect is that all files that would otherwise be automatically
excluded are considered.
.TP
.BI -x SPECIAL
Arguments starting with
.B -x
(except
.BR -xdev ,
explained elsewhere) do special interaction with the
.I ~/.search
startup file. Something like
.nf
	-xflag1 -xflag2
.fi
will turn on "flag1" and "flag2" in the startup file (and is
the same as "-xflag1,flag2"). You can use this to write your own
rules for what kinds of files are to be considered.

For example, the internal-default startup file contains the line
.nf
	<!~> option: -skip '~ #'
.fi
This means that if the
.B -x~
flag is
.I not
seen, the option
.nf
    -skip '~ #'
.fi
should be done.
The effect is that emacs temp and backup files are not normally
considered, but you can included them with the -x~ flag.

You can write your own rules to customize
.I search
in powerful ways. See the STARTUP FILE section below.
.TP
.B -why
Print a message (to stderr) when and why a file is not considered.

.SH "OPTIONS TELLING WHAT TO DO WITH FILES THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED"
.TP
\fB-find\fP or \fB-b\fP
This option changes the basic action of
.IR search .

Normally, if a file is considered, it is searched
for the regular expressions as described earlier. However, if this option
is given, the filename is printed and no searching takes place. This turns
.I search
into a 'find' of some sorts.

In this case, no regular expressions are needed on the command line
(any that are there are silently ignored).

This is not intended to be a replacement for the 'find' program,
but to aid
you in understanding just what files are getting past the exclusion checks.
If you really want to use it as a sort of replacement for the 'find' program,
you might want to use
.B -all
so that it doesn't waste time checking to see if the file is binary, etc
(unless you really want that, of course).

If you use
.BR -find ,
none of the "GREP-LIKE OPTIONS" (below) matter.

As a replacement for 'find',
.I search
is probably a bit slower (or in the case of GNU find, a lot slower --
GNU find is
.I unbelievably
fast).
However, "search -ffind"
might be more useful than 'find' when options such as
.B -skip
are used (at least until 'find' gets such functionality).
.TP
\fB-ffind\fP or \fB-ff\fP
A faster more 'find'-like find. Does
.nf
    -find  -all -dorep
.fi
.SH "GREP-LIKE OPTIONS"
These options control how a searched file is accessed,
and how things are printed.
.TP
\fB-F\fP or \fB-lit\fP
Causes arguments to be taken as literal text rather than as perl regular
expressions.
.TP
\fB-R\fP or \fB-regex\fP
Undoes
.BR -T .
Regex arguments are indeed taken as perl regular expressions.
.TP
.B -i
Ignore letter case when matching.
.TP
.B -noi
Don't ignore letter case when matching (useful for overriding a
.B -i
in the startup file)
.TP
.B -w
Consider only whole-word matches ("whole word" as defined by perl's "\\b"
regex).
.TP
.B -u
If the regex(es) is/are simple, try to modify them so that they'll work
in manpage-like underlined text (i.e. like _^Ht_^Hh_^Hi_^Hs).
This is very rudimentary at the moment.
.TP
\fB-list\fP or \fB-l\fP
.B -list
Don't print matching lines, but the names of files that contain matching
lines. This will likely be *much* faster, as special optimizations are
made -- particularly with large files.
.TP
.B -n
Pepfix each line by its line number.
.TP
.B -nice
Not a grep-like option, but similar to
.BR -list ,
so included here.
.B -nice
will have the output be a bit more human-readable, with matching lines printed
slightly indented after the filename, a'la
.nf

   % search foo
   somedir/somefile: line with foo in it
   somedir/somefile: some food for thought
   anotherdir/x: don't be a buffoon!
   %

.fi
will become
.nf

   % search -nice foo
   somedir/somefile:
     line with foo in it
     some food for thought
   anotherdir/x:
     don't be a buffoon!
   %

.fi
This option due to Lionel Cons.
.TP
.B -nnice
Be a bit nicer than
.BR -nice .
Prefix each file's output by a rule line, and follow with an extra blank line.
.TP
.B -h
Don't prepend each output line with the name of the file
(meaningless when
.B -find
or
.B -l
are given).

.SH "OPTIONS WHICH INDICATE HOW TO DISPLAY"
In addition to the
.B \-nice
and
.B \-nnice
from just above, you can use the following if your display supports
ANSI escape sequences (most systems seem to).
.TP
.B \-bold
Show the found items in reverse video.
.TP
.B \-red
Show the found items in red.
.TP
.B \-green
Show the found items in green.
.TP
.B \-yellow
Show the found items in yellow.
.TP
.B \-blue
Show the found items in blue.
.TP
.B \-cyan
Show the found items in cyan.
.TP
.B \-white
Show the found items in white.
.TP
.B \-black
Show the found items in black.

.SH "OTHER OPTIONS"
.TP
.B -help
Print the usage information.
.TP
.B -version
Print the version information and quit.
.TP
.B -v
Set the level of message verbosity.
.B -v
will print a note whenever a new directory is entered.
.B -vv
will also print a note "every so often". This can be useful to see
what's happening when searching huge directories.
.B -vvv
will print a new with every file.
.B -vvvv
is
-vvv
plus
.BR -why .
.TP
.B -e
This ends the options, and can be useful if the regex begins with '-'.
.TP
.B -showrc
Shows what is being considered in the startup file, then exits.
.TP
.B -dorep
Normally, an identical file won't be checked twice (even with multiple
hard or symbolic links). If you're just trying to do a fast
.BR -find ,
the bookkeeping to remember which files have been seen is not desirable,
so you can eliminate the bookkeeping with this flag.

.SH "STARTUP FILE"
When
.I search
starts up, it processes the directives in
.IR ~/.search .
If no such file exists, a default
internal version is used.

The internal version looks like:
.nf

   magic: 32 : $H =~ m/[\ex00-\ex06\ex10-\ex1a\ex1c-\ex1f\ex80\exff]{2}/
   filter: $N =~ m/\.(gz|Z)$/ : "zcat %"
   option: -skip '.a .COM .elc .EXE .o .pbm .xbm .dvi'
   option: -iskip '.tarz .zip .lzh .jpg .jpeg .gif .uu'
   <!~> option: -skip '~ #'

.fi
If you wish to create your own "~/.search",
you might consider copying the above, and then working from there.

There are three kinds of directives in a startup file: "filter", "magic"
and "option".

.RS 0n
.TP
OPTION
Option lines will automatically do the command-line options given.
For example, the line
.nf
    option: -v
.fi
in you startup file will turn on -v every time, without needing to type it
on the command line.

The text on the line after the "option:" directive is processed
like the Bourne shell, so make sure to pay attention to quoting.
.nf
    option: -skip .exe .com
.fi
will give an error (".com" by itself isn't a valid option), while
.nf
    option: -skip ".exe .com"
.fi
will properly include it as part of -skip's argument.

.TP
MAGIC
Magic lines are used to determine if a file should be considered a binary
or not (the term "magic" refers to checking a file's magic number).  These
are described in more detail below.

.TP
FILTER
Filter lines are used to apply a command to a file to get the text to search.
The format of a
.B FILTER
line is:
.nf
    filter : EXPRESSION: "command...."
.fi
where
.I EXPRESSION
is a perl expression used to determine if the filter should be applied to a
given file (the file's name will be in the variable $N, but remember that
files excluded via
.BR -skip ,
etc., won't even be considered for a filter). If true, the
.I COMMAND
will be executed and its standard-output will be checked. ``\fB%\fP'' in the
command string will be replace by the filename.

The most common example would be to uncompress a file on the fly, i.e.
.nf
   filter: $N =~ m/\.(gz|Z)$/ : "zcat %"
.fi
Note that had the ``\fBzcat\fP'' been ``\fBgunzip\fP'' instead, you'd
uncompress your files in place instead of searching them, so take care when
specifying a filter! If you're worried about mixing up GNU'z zcat with
an old one, you might use seperate ones as with:
.nf
   filter: $N =~ m/\.gz$/ : "/my/GNU/binaries/zcat %"
   filter: $N =~ m/\.Z$/ : "/the/non-GNU/binaries/zcat %"
.fi 

Also note that when a filter is applied, the
.B MAGIC
section is ignored for the file (this can be considered a bug, so it might
change in the future).

.RE

Blank lines and comments (lines beginning with '#') are allowed.

If a line begins with  <...>, then it's a check to see if the
directive on the line should be done or not. The stuff inside the <...>
can contain perl's && (and), || (or), ! (not), and parens for grouping,
along with "flags" that might be indicated by the user with
.BI -x flag
options.

For example, using "-xfoo" will cause "foo" to be true inside the <...>
blocks. Therefore, a line beginning with "<foo>" would be done only when
"-xfoo" had been specified, while a line beginning with "<!foo>" would be
done only when "-xfoo" is not specified (of course, a line without any <...>
is done in either case).

A realistic example might be
.nf
	<!v> -vv
.fi
This will cause -vv messages to be the default, but allow "-xv" to override.

There are a few flags that are set automatically:
.RS
.TP
.B TTY
true if the output is to the screen (as opposed to being redirected to a file).
You can force this (as with all the other automatic flags) with -xTTY.
.TP
.B -v
True if -v was specified. If -vv was specified, both 
.B -v
and
.B -vv
flags are true (and so on).
.TP
.B -nice
True if -nice was specified. Same thing about -nnice as for -vv.
.PP
.TP
.B -list
true if -list (or -l) was given.
.TP
.B -dir
true if -dir was given.
.RE

Using this info, you might change the last example to
.nf

    <!v && !-v> option: -vv

.fi
The added "&& !-v" means "and if the '-v' option not given".
This will allow you to use "-v" alone on the command line, and not
have this directive add the more verbose "-vv" automatically.

.RS 0
Some other examples:
.TP
<!-dir && !here> option: -dir ~/
Effectively make the default directory your home directory (instead of the
current directory). Using -dir or -xhere will undo this.
.TP
<tex> option: -name .tex -dir ~/pub
Create '-xtex' to search only "*.tex" files in your ~/pub directory tree.
Actually, this could be made a bit better. If you combine '-xtex' and '-dir'
on the command line, this directive will add ~/pub to the list, when you
probably want to use the -dir directory only. You could do
.nf

   <tex> option: -name .tex
   <tex && !-dir> option: -dir ~/pub
.fi

to will allow '-xtex' to work as before, but allow a command-line "-dir"
to take precedence with respect to ~/pub.
.TP
<fluff> option: -nnice -sort -i -vvv
Combine a few user-friendly options into one '-xfluff' option.
.TP
<man> option: -ddir /usr/man -v -w
When the '-xman' option is given, search "/usr/man" for whole-words
(of whatever regex or regexes are given on the command line), with -v.
.RE

The lines in the startup file are executed from top to bottom, so something
like
.nf

   <both> option: -xflag1 -xflag2
   <flag1> option: ...whatever...
   <flag2> option: ...whatever...

.fi
will allow '-xboth' to be the same as '-xflag1 -xflag2' (or '-xflag1,flag2'
for that matter). However, if you put the "<both>" line below the others,
they will not be true when encountered, so the result would be different
(and probably undesired).

The "magic" directives are used to determine if a file looks to be binary
or not. The form of a magic line is
.nf
    magic: \fISIZE\fP : \fIPERLCODE\fP
.fi
where
.I SIZE
is the number of bytes of the file you need to check, and
.I PERLCODE
is the code to do the check. Within
.IR PERLCODE ,
the variable $H will hold at least the first
.I SIZE
bytes of the file (unless the file is shorter than that, of course).
It might hold more bytes. The perl should evaluate to true if the file
should be considered a binary.

An example might be
.nf
    magic: 6 : substr($H, 0, 6) eq 'GIF87a'
.fi
to test for a GIF ("-iskip .gif" is better, but this might be useful
if you have images in files without the ".gif" extension).

Since the startup file is checked from top to bottom, you can be a bit
efficient:
.nf
    magic: 6 : ($x6 = substr($H, 0, 6)) eq 'GIF87a'
    magic: 6 :  $x6                     eq 'GIF89a'
.fi
You could also write the same thing as
.nf
  magic: 6 : (($x6 = substr($H, 0, 6)) eq 'GIF87a') || ## an old gif, or.. \e
	       $x6                     eq 'GIF89a'     ## .. a new one.
.fi
since newlines may be escaped.

The default internal startup file includes
.nf
   magic: 32 : $H =~ m/[\ex00-\ex06\ex10-\ex1a\ex1c-\ex1f\ex80\exff]{2}/
.fi
which checks for certain non-printable characters, and catches a large
number of binary files, including most system's executables, linkable
objects, compressed, tarred, and otherwise folded, spindled, and mutilated
files.

Another example might be
.nf
    ## an archive library
    magic: 17 : substr($H, 0, 17) eq "!<arch>\en__.SYMDEF"
.fi

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.I Search
returns zero if lines (or files, if appropriate) were found,
or if no work was requested (such as with
.BR -help ).
Returns 1 if no lines (or files) were found.
Returns 2 on error.

.SH TODO
Things I'd like to add some day:
.nf
  + show surrounding lines (context).
  + highlight matched portions of lines.
  + add '-and', which can go between regexes to override
    the default logical or of the regexes.
  + add something like
      -below GLOB
    which will examine a tree and only consider files that
    lie in a directory deeper than one named by the pattern.
  + add 'warning' and 'error' directives.
  + add 'help' directive.
.fi
.SH BUGS
If -xdev and multiple -dir arguments are given, any file in any of the
target filesystems are allowed. It would be better to allow each filesystem
for each separate tree.

Multiple -dir args might also cause some confusing effects. Doing
.nf
   -dir some/dir -dir other
.fi
will search "some/dir" completely, then search "other" completely. This
is good. However, something like
.nf
   -dir some/dir -dir some/dir/more/specific
.fi
will search "some/dir" completely *except for* "some/dir/more/specific",
after which it will return and be searched. Not really a bug, but just sort
of odd.

File times (for -newer, etc.) of symbolic links are for the file, not the
link. This could cause some misunderstandings.

Probably more. Please let me know.
